# Python-challenge

Inside the PyBank folder, you will find a script that is used to help analyze budget/financial data for a company. The data is in a csv file and includes two columns, Date and Profit/Losses.


The script will produce:

The total number of months included in the dataset.
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
When the script is finished, the financial analysis will be printed to the terminal as well as exported to a text file in the same directory as the script.

PyPoll
Inside the PyPoll folder, you will find a script that is used to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. The data is in a csv file and includes three columns, Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

The csv file being analyzed is located here. The script file is located here.

When you run the script, the script analyzes the votes and calculates the following:

The total number of votes cast.
A complete list of candidates who received votes.
The percentage of votes each candidate won.
The total number of votes each candidate won.
The winner of the election based on popular vote.
When the script is finished, the election results will be printed to the terminal as well as exported to a text file in the same directory as the script.

Running the scripts
To run either one of the scripts:

Download or clone this repository to a local directory on your computer.

From a command line terminal (for example, Git Bash on Windows), change directory into the root directory (python-challenge) and then change directory into the PyBank or PyPoll directory, depending on which script you want to run.

Run the script by running the following command:

python main.py
When finished, the script prints the results to the terminal and exports the results to a text file in the same directory as the script.
